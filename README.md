<b>Overview of SDM Policy</b>: Our method distills the Diffusion Policy, which requires long inference times and high computational costs, into a fast and stable one-step generator. Our SDM Policy is represented by the one-step generator, which requires continual correction and optimization via the Corrector during training, but relies solely on the generator during evaluation. The corrector's optimization is based on two components: gradient optimization and diffusion optimization. The gradient optimization part primarily involves optimizing the entire distribution by minimizing the KL divergence between two distributions, $P_{\theta}$ and $D_{\theta}$, with distribution details represented through a score function that guides the gradient update direction, providing a clear signal. The diffusion optimization component enables $D_{\theta}$ to quickly track changes in the one-step generator‚Äôs output, maintaining consistency. Details on loading observational data for both evaluation and training processes are provided above the diagram. Our method applies to both 2D and 3D scenarios.

# üíª Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation instructions. 

# üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Scripts for generating demonstrations, training, and evaluation are all provided in the `scripts/` folder. 

The results are logged by `wandb`, so you need to `wandb login` first to see the results and videos.

For more detailed parameter Settings and descriptions, refer to scripts and codes. We have provided a simple illustration of using the code base here.


1. Generate demonstrations by `gen_demonstration_adroit.sh` and `gen_demonstration_dexart.sh`. See the scripts for details. For example:
    ```bash
    bash scripts/gen_demonstration_adroit.sh hammer
    ```
    This will generate demonstrations for the `hammer` task in Adroit environment. The data will be saved in `SDM/data/` folder automatically.


2. Train and evaluate a teacher policy with behavior cloning. For example:
    ```bash
    # bash scripts/train_policy.sh config_name task_name addition_info seed gpu_id 
    bash scripts/train_policy.sh dp3 adroit_hammer 0901 0 0
    ```
    This will train a DP3 policy on the `hammer` task in Adroit environment using point cloud modality. By default we **save** the ckpt (optional in the script). 
   
3. Copy teacher's ckpt. For example:
    ```bash
    # bash scripts/cp_teacher.sh alg_name task_name teacher_addition_info addition_info seed gpu_id
    bash scripts/cp_teacher.sh dp3_sdm adroit_hammer 0901 0901_sdm 0 0
    ```
    This will create a folder for student model training and copy the checkpoint for the specified teacher model here.
    
4. Train and evaluate SDM Policy. For example:
    ```bash
    # bash scripts/train_policy_sdm.sh config_name task_name addition_info seed gpu_id
    bash scripts/train_policy_sdm.sh dp3_sdm adroit_hammer 0901_sdm 0 0
    ```
    This will train SDM Policy use a DP3 policy teacher model on the `hammer` task in Adroit environment using point cloud modality.

We are uploading gradually, sorry to say that due to the total checkpoints of about 600G, we are actively looking for a public storage platform for storage. Please contact us for priority updates if necessary.
